# Subject_Lines_Open_Rates

**DRAFT**

I looked at the relationship between e-mail subject lines and open and click through rates at a daily deal site for Vinyl Collectors.
The data set includes ove 500 email campaigns sent in 2016.<br />
<br />
Features for the multi variate regression model include:
* The total revenue we generated from the artist mentioned in the subject line. If no artist mentioned, it's $0. (As a proxy of the popularity of the artist)
* The time sent
* Weekday sent
* $ amount off 
* % amount off
<br />

Categorical variables for words like:
* Discount
* Sale
* Blow Out
* Exclusive
* Limited
* Vinyl
* Box Set
* Off
* Save

etc.
